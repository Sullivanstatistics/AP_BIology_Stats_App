Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement.  Their weights in grams after six weeks are given along with feed types.

This data contains 71 observations with the following variables

- **weight** - a numeric variable giving the chick weight.
-  **feed** - a factor giving the feed type.
